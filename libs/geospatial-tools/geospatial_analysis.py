# geospatial_analysis.py
# Script for handling and analyzing geospatial data in AI-Environmental-Monitoring

# For the AI-Environmental-Monitoring project, let's create a fictitious Python script that focuses on handling and analyzing geospatial data. This script, which could be named geospatial_analysis.py, will be dedicated to processing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial information, which is crucial for environmental monitoring. This file would be appropriately placed in the geospatial-tools library within the project.

# In this script:

# A GeospatialAnalysis class is created with methods to load and analyze both vector and raster geospatial data.
# Geopandas is used for processing vector data, and rasterio is used for handling raster data.
# The script includes a simple method to plot raster data and a placeholder method for more advanced vector data analysis.
# This example assumes the presence of geospatial data in GeoJSON and TIFF formats for vector and raster data, respectively.
# This script, as part of the geospatial-tools library in the AI-Environmental-Monitoring project, would be vital for analyzing geospatial data, which is fundamental in monitoring and understanding environmental changes and patterns.
